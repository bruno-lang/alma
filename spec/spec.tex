\title{Formal Languages as Structured Grammars}
\author{Jan Bernitt}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent Structured Grammars describe the semantics of a programming language independent system to model a formal language as data together with the formal process of a generic solver that is controlled by a grammar in order to parse a document formulated in the grammars syntax into a index overlay parse-tree.
\end{abstract}
\section{Grammar as Data}
\subsection{Types of Rules}
\paragraph{Matching Bytes}
\begin{rulelist}
\item[LITERAL] Matches an exact sequence of UTF-8 bytes.
\item[TERMINAL] Matches ranges of UTF-8 code-points.
\item[PATTERN] Matches an abstract pattern of UTF-8 bytes. The length of matching bytes is given through a particular algorithm for a particular pattern. This is the only non-concrete building block.
\end{rulelist}

\paragraph{Matching Structure}
\begin{rulelist}
\item[SEQUENCE] Wraps two or more components that have to sequently follow each other. Matches if all its components match.
\item[SELECTION] Wraps two or more alternative components. The alternatives are ordered from highest to lowest priority. Matches as soon as highest yet tried component matches.
\item[ITERATION] Wraps one component that has to occur at least as often as a defined minimum and as most as often as a defined maximum occurrence. Matches as long as the number of times its component matches the proceeding input is within the specified range of occurrences.
\item[COMPLETION] Can be used within sequences to match all input until the component following it in the sequence matches from there on. 
\end{rulelist}

\paragraph{Model the Parse Tree}
\begin{rulelist}
\item[CAPTURE] Wraps one component and associates it with a name. This names the rule component (for reference) and the resulting parse tree node at the same time. As long as the wrapped component matches an element a frame is pushed onto the parse tree stack describing start and end position, nesting level and rule of the matching component.
\end{rulelist}

\paragraph{Bootstrapping}
\begin{rulelist}
\item[REFERENCE] bar
\end{rulelist}
